         <h2>High School Robot</h2>
         <p>My junior year of HighSchool, one of my classmates brought to school an actual tiny robot he made from the ground up himself. Being so young, I thought it was very interesting he could do this all by himself. Of course I asked him about a million questions, which all lead back to coding. This was the first time I had an interest in technology - but it was years before I gave it anymore thought because I doubted that I could ever be smart enough to work in tech.</p>

         <h2>Working at Invisalink</h2>
         <p>In 2019, I landed a job at an internet company called Invisalink. At first, I was only the receptionist. Eventually I was trained to the tech side of things, like working in routers from my browser. I definitely learned a lot from this company, and having said position sky-rockted my interest with having a career in tech, I just didn't know where to start.</p>

         <h2>Moving To Illinois</h2>
         <p>Fast forward to 2023, my family and I relocated to Alton, Illinois for work. My partner's aunt asked me one day what my career-interests were and I told her I would love to work in tech, but was restricted on going to school being that I am a stay at home mom. She told me about this program called "Coder-Girl" that a friend of hers had completed, and the rest is history! I researched LaunchCode, applied, and was accepted! I've fallen in love with tech and cannot wait to see where this program takes me.</p>
